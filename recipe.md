Once the cupcakes are made and cooled, using a frosting tip of choice, swirl frosting on top of the cupcake to make a mound. 
Next using a serrated spatula, smooth out the frosting making a smooth mound. {Pictured above.}
Melt the pink candy melts in a deep bowl until melted, in 30 second increments in the microwave.
Dip the top of the cupcake into the melted candy. 
Sprinkle a few white pearls on top and then top with a cherry.
In a small bowl, portion about 1/2 cup frosting and dye it dark pink.
Put the dark pink frosting into a frosting bag fitted with a #3 tip. Pipe a swirl around the cupcake. 
Enjoy! 

Pinkalicious Cake Recipe:

Instructions:
Prepare two three 6"x2" cake pans with cake goop or another preferred pan spray. Fill your pans about 3/4 of the way full of batter. 
Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer with the paddle attachment. Mix 10 seconds to combine. 
Combine 1/2 cup of the milk and the oil together and set aside. 
Combine the remaining milk, egg whites, pink food coloring and vanilla together, whisk to break up the eggs and set aside. 
Add your softened butter to the dry ingredients and mix on low until mixture resembles a coarse sand (about 30 seconds). Add in your milk/oil mixture and let mix until dry ingredients are moistened and then bump up to med (setting 4 on my kitchenaid) and let mix for 2 minutes to develop the cakes structure. If you don't let your cake mix on this step your cake could collapse. 
Scrape your bowl and then reduce speed to low. Add in your egg white mixture in three batches, letting the batter mix for 15 seconds between additions. 
Scrape down the sides again to make sure everything has incorporated then pour into prepared pans.
Bake 35-40 minutes until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out cleanly but the cake has not begun to shrink yet from the sides of the pan. 
IMMEDIATELY TAP PAN FIRMLY on countertop once to release the steam from the cake. This stops the cake from shrinking. 
Let cakes cool for 10 minutes inside the pan before flipping them out. The cake will shrink a bit and that is normal. Flip onto a cooling rack and let cool fully. I chill my cakes before handling or you can wrap them in plastic wrap and freeze them to trap moisture in the cake. Thaw on the countertop while still wrapped before frosting. 


Stabilized Whipped Cream:
Sprinkle your gelatin over the water and let bloom for 5 minutes. 
Melt gelatin for 5 seconds in the microwave. If not fully melted do another 3 seconds. You can tell gelatin is melted when there are no granules of unmelted gelatin visible.
After dissolving your gelatin, add in 1 tsp of heavy cream and mix. If your gelatin is too cold, heat again until it's melted (5 seconds).
In a cold mixing bowl, whip your heavy cream to soft peaks
Add in your powdered sugar and vanilla and mix until combined
Turn your mixer down to low and drizzle in your gelatin and mix until whipped cream forms stiff peaks. Do not over-mix or your whipped cream will turn into butter.


Bake your pink velvet cake layers and let them cool
Trim off the dome and the brown sides of the cake if you want your cake slice to be really pretty
Make your stabilized whipped cream
Place your first layer of cake onto your cake board or plate
Use an offset spatula to spread a layer of whipped cream on top of the cake then place your second layer of cake on top of the whipped cream. Repeat with the final layer of cake. 
Spread a thin layer of whipped cream all over your cake and then put the whole cake into the freezer for 10 minutes
Spread a final layer of whipped cream on top of the cake
Use a bench scraper to make the sides straight and an offset spatula to make the top flat
Optional: use a cake comb to make the sides more interesting
Finish the cake design with some swirls of whipped cream on top using a 1M piping tip and finish with some fresh raspberries.
